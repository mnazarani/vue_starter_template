# vue_starter_template

This a basic vue starter template created with Vitejs.  Currently, Tailwindcss and Tailwind/forms are isntalled and configured.  To change default setting of form elments look and feel, edit the settings in index.css in src directory.  This is a work in progress. I am creating this template to help with another project that will be heavy on forms. 

TO DO:
- Add base form elment components that are globally accessible. 
- setup basic Vue router
- setup basic Vuex store
- setup form validation using Vuelidate
